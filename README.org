* Ciao - an OAuth 2.0 Client for Common Lisp

*Ciao* is an easy-to-use Common Lisp OAuth 2.0 client library. 
It is a port of the 
[[https://docs.racket-lang.org/webapi/oauth2.html][Racket OAuth 2.0 Client]]
(package: ~webapi~) to Common Lisp.

** Installation

To install ~ciao~, you should download the repository into your local
lisp directory (e.g., "~/.roswell/local-projects/", "~/portacle/projects/",
"~/quicklisp/local-projects/").

It has been tested for use on [[https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication][Google]] and [[https://app.clio.com/api/v4/documentation][Clio]] APIs with SBCL and CCL
on GNU/Linux and SBCL on MacOS.

*** Notable Dependencies

All of ~ciao~'s dependencies are available on [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]].

~ciao~ uses [[https://github.com/fukamachi/dexador][~dexador~]] for http requests and [[https://common-lisp.net/project/cl-json/cl-json.html][~cl-json~]] to parse JSON
responses. To retrieve responses from the OAuth server, ~ciao~ starts a
[[https://edicl.github.io/hunchentoot/][~hunchentoot~]] server that blocks the thread until it receives a
response from the OAuth server. Finally, ~ciao~ uses
[[https://github.com/eudoxia0/trivial-open-browser][~trivial-open-browser~]] to open a web browser to obtain client
authorization.

** Usage

The simplest method to obtain authorization from an OAuth 2.0 server is
to use ~oauth2/request-auth-code/browser~, which opens up a browser window
to get approval and returns an ~oauth2~ object, which represents a client
authorized to access some set of resources.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; load the system
  (asdf:load-system "ciao")

  ;; create a parameter *oauth-ojb* and assign the return value
  (defparameter *oauth-obj* nil)

  ;; assign the value of oauth2/request-auth-code/browser to *oauth-obj*
  (setf *oauth-obj*
        (ciao:oauth2/request-auth-code/browser
         ciao:*google-auth-server*
         (make-instance 'ciao:oauth2-client :secret "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
                                            :id     "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
         :scopes '("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly")))

  ;; use dexador to request a file's information
  (dex:get "https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
           :headers (ciao:headers *oauth-obj*))
#+END_SRC

In the above example, ~id~ and ~secret~ represent the client authentication
information from Google.
